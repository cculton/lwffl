# Thoughts on your LWFFL project

You clearly put real effort into this site and organized it around league-specific pages (standings, records, matchups, etc.), which is exactly what makes a fantasy league site feel personal and fun.

My honest take:
- The concept is strong and has personality.
- Breaking content into dedicated pages was a good decision.
- You are much farther along than a typical beginner project.

If you rebuild from here, I’d suggest:
1. Start with one clean homepage and one reusable navigation component.
2. Keep all league data in JSON and render pages from that data.
3. Add a small style system (colors, spacing, card layout) before adding lots of features.
4. Ship one feature at a time: standings -> weekly results -> records -> extras.

You’re not a “noob” in the way most people mean it — you already did the hardest part: making something real.
